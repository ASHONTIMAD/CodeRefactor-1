  link to webpage [Here](file:///Users/ashontimadison/Desktop/Homework/codeRefactor/CodeRefactor-1/Develop/index.html

This was made possible by erasing some empty divs and adding semactic elements for accessiblity. As well as fixing the broken link on the webpage.
Also fixed the CSS code by deleting a lot of repaeting selectors and properties by consildateding them and re organizing them.
